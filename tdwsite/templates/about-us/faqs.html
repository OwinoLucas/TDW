                            <p>As of mid-2023, we have about 190 people on our waiting list. Do not be disheartened though. The demand for a place varies greatly in terms of the type of accommodation and the time frame they might want it in. It is almost impossible to gauge the demand at any one time and we simply go to our list and put the word out whenever we have a property available. Sometimes, where we have a known prospective resident who is very senior on the list, we simply enquire directly with those few members who have seniority rather than going to the whole list and raising unreal expectations. To get on our &ldquo;Waiting List&rdquo; one has to join as a &ldquo;Friend&rdquo; of Fairseat first. At the time of writing, this costs Kes 2,000/= per annum but is subject to change from time to time. To get onto the &ldquo;Waiting List&rdquo; one has to pay a one-off fee of Kes 5,000/=. Contact the Fairseat office for details on joining and paying for the membership fee and the waiting list.</p>

                            <p>We welcome pets but specific application must be made to the manager for each and every pet. The manager makes the decision as to whether a pet is allowed and there is no further avenue of appeal or negotiation. The major determinant as to whether a pet is allowed is its ability to add to the quality of life of the community &ndash; and most certainly not to detract from that in any way at all. All pets must have current vaccinations, appropriate licenses, be controllable and controlled, properly cared for and in good condition. As a general rule we tend to welcome old loyal pets and tend to dislike young, untrained animals.</p>

                            <p>Anyone can act as your guarantor who we can actually go back to for payment if you leave Fairseat with debts unpaid. It is most common for family members to be asked to act as guarantors but they should be financially able to act as a guarantor. They must understand that if you leave Fairseat Foundation with debts unpaid, then we will look to them to pay the outstanding dues. It is important that they understand that some of these debts may well be third party liabilities - for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fairseat will purchase prescription drugs for a resident,</li>
	<li>Fairseat will sometimes assist residents to exit a local hospital easily and quickly by having the hospital bill settled on its account.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guarantors will be held responsible for any such debts that remain unpaid.</p>

                            <p>Fairseat has &ldquo;Fibre to the Home&rdquo; provided by Safaricom to all its residences and some residences have access to JTL as well. Residents can access the internet by opening an account directly with the internet provider or simply speak to the office and they can assist in organising it but the cost is to the individual resident. Internet providers offer a range of packages depending upon the speed desired.</p>

<p>There is presently limited WiFi publicly available within the grounds of Fairseat but this is not guaranteed into the future. The password to access this WiFi can be obtained from the office.</p>

                            <p>No - you cannot take over your mother&rsquo;s residence when she passes on. The contract is clear that the residency arrangement with your mother ends when she leaves Fairseat. You need to join as a Friend of Fairseat and get on the Waiting List in order to create your own position as a potential resident. The right of abode is not transferrable.</p>

                            <p>You need to bring everything for your residence. So you need appropriate furniture, bedding, pictures, curtains, and carpets. You need at least one set of personal cutlery and crockery if you are planning to take any meals or tea items in your residence. Generally residents would have enough for themselves and also a few guests. Bits and pieces that help to make the new residence feel like home are encouraged. Try to avoid the temptation of over-furnishing though. Many prospective residents will be coming from large family homes and it is not always sensible to bring such large furniture into the smaller residences of Fairseat.</p>

                            <p>The Entry Interview is purely that &ndash; a chat with our &ldquo;Entry Committee&rdquo;. There is no physical medical examination at all. The applicant is required to furnish the committee with a comprehensive medical report from their GP that covers their medical history and their current medical condition and details their medications. Whilst the applicant can be accompanied to Fairseat for the interview with somebody they trust, they will attend the actual interview on their own. It is intended to be a process to identify applicants who are not actually suitable for the Fairseat experience or whom Fairseat are unlikely to be able to care for in an appropriate manner. Not everyone will suit Fairseat and we try to identify this before they enter. In particular, Fairseat does not normally accept applicants who do not want to be coming to Fairseat.</p>
